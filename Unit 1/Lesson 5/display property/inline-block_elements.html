    <p>As you can see, our divs, which would normally be block level elements, are rendered side by side. Because we've set their width to 25%, together, they take up 100% of the width of their parent (the -main- element).<br><br>
    
    If you look over the CSS in this Codepen closely, however, you may find something that looks suspicious. What on earth is the font-size: 0; declaration on the main element? For better or worse, it's a common CSS hack used to remove whitespace between inline-block elements. Try removing the font-size: 0; declaration from this Codepen, and you'll see that our divs now spill onto a second row, and there's a small white space between each one.<br><br>
        
    So where is the white space coming from? To understand this, let's have a look at what happens when we put span elements (which are inline by default) on separate lines, which is what we did above with our div elements.</p><br><br>

    <p>
        <span>foo</span><span>bar</span>
    </p>
      
    <p>
        <span>bizz</span>
        <span>bang</span>
    </p>

    <p>In the first paragraph, "foo" and "bar" have no white space because the spans are right next to each other. In the second paragraph, however, there's a space between "bizz" and "bang" because the browser interprets the line break between the two spans as a space. <br><br>

    One of the solutions to this problem is to set font-size: 0; on the parent element, as we did above in the example with the colored boxes. This solution works because when the browser tries to render a space between the elements, that space gets a size of 0. <br><br>
    Also know that there are other strategies for solving the underlying layout problem (How do I get set width elements to appear together on the same line?). One is to use the float property, and another is to use -table- elements for layout. Before inline-block was implemented, these were the only two ways to solve this problem, but there are drawbacks to both. Be prepared to encounter legacy code and outdated tutorials that use floats and tables to get set-width elements to appear on the same line, but don't use these solutions in your own work. Tables are for displaying tabular data, and floats have some good use cases (one of which is discussed below), but don't use them to achieve what inline-block gives you.</p> <br> <br>
