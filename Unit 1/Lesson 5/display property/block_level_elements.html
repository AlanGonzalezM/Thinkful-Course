    <!--In the Codepen above, the first paragraph contains a span element, and the second paragraph gets displayed on a new line, below the first paragraph. Note how we've also explicitly set a max-width for paragraph elements appearing in this Codepen (a common practice because it's hard for users to read overly wide paragraphs).-->

            <div class="inner-one"></div>
            <div class="inner-two"></div>

        <p>As you can see, <span class="blue">.inner-one defaults to takes up 100% of its <span class="red">parent's width</span> by default</span>, while <span class="green">only takes up 50% of its <span class="red">parent's width</span> because we have explicitly set the width property</span>.</p>
